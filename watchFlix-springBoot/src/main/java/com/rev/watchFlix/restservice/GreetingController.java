Labour divisions then led to the rise of a leisured upper class and the development of cities. The growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of writing and accounting. Many cities developed on the banks of lakes and rivers; as early as 3000 BCE some of the first prominent, well-developed settlements had arisen in Mesopotamia (The Land between the Rivers), on the banks of Egypt's Nile River, in the Indus River valley, and along the major rivers of China.\",\n" +

However, culturally and genetically, Ancient Egypt was much more a part of the Middle East. Sure, it had interaction with Kush but it had far more interaction with the Levant, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia. I therefore felt it was better to place Egypt next to these civilizations. In the video, I summarized the horizontal sections (which are not actually labeled at all on the physical poster) as the Americas, Africa, Europe, Asia & the Pacific but it would have been more accurate to describe them as the Americas, Sub Saharan Africa, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, the Pacific.\",\n" +
